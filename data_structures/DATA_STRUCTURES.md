#Data Structures
In this article, I will mainly introduce the most well-known data structures on a technical level but let's first start with my understanding of data structures.

Different data structures are different representations of data. Due to these distinct features owned by these different representations, we could always describe a data structure from the following aspects:

1. The properties, features of a data structure;

2. Within a data structure, what kind of operations could be applied on it either to reflect some properties of a data structure either manipulate the data stored in such a data structure.

Based on the two aspects above, we first introduce 
##Stack
###Properties
The most important property, which could be used to distinguish a stack from other data structures, is "first in, last out", which means that the ealier an element is stored in a stack, the later it can be retrieved. To make it more clear, we could regard a stack as a container of which the size can only fit one book at one time. Thus, each time we could play one book inside. So if we keep putting books inside, every time we want to retrieve a book, we can only get the book on top of this book. That is exactly how a stack works.
###Operations and Imlementations
Based on the property of a stack, there are three types of basic operations:

1. isEmpty: Check if the stack is empty or not.

2. Pop: Po


3.
